# ArbReals
real intervals with floating point bounds (uses the Arb library)

###ToDo

(a) find a fast way to express (midpoint & radius) as a most informed *value*  
   >> See ArbFloats' string functions for a way that works, faster would help.
    
(b) make library's fetch & build independant of Nemo
