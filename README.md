ArbReals
========

real intervals with floating point bounds (uses the Arb library)

**under construction**

### ToDo

1.  find a fast way to express (midpoint & radius) as a most informed *value*  
    \>\> See ArbFloats' string functions for a way that works, faster would
    help.

2.  make library's fetch & build independant of Nemo

3.  wrap and export standard interval predicates and operators

4.  define missing math functions (csc, sec, csch, sech, acsc, asec..)
